How to show code

`code` - shows code on 1 line

```
let x = 1;
let y = 5;
```

By surrounding them with 3 (```) It preservves the indentation. you can even label it with the language that you use so it will be rendered in the syntax according.

how do you create a link? [this is a link ] + ()
in the parenthesis you put the link that you want to lead to.

[example link](https://google.com)

you can also use <https://google.com>

Images have the same syntax but we need to place ! before the parenthesis+ bracket structure.

Example: ! + [ ] + () = ![]()
in the square brackets you can use the alt text
in the parethesis you can place the png/webp/jpeg format. OR uRL that points to an image.
