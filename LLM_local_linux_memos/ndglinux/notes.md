What is Linux?

- Before we determine what makes Linux such a great asset to your skill-set, let’s define it first. Linux is operating system software that runs on a hardware computer system. An operating system is software that allows other programs like word processors and web browsers to be installed and run on a computer.

- Different commands:
  - the **ls** command displays a listing of information about files.
  - command [options…] [arguments…] is the syntax.
  -
- Options can be used to alter the behavior of a command. On the previous page, the ls command was used to list the contents of a directory. In the following example, the -l option is provided to the ls command, which results in a "long display" output, meaning the output gives more information about each of the files listed:

```
ls -l
```

- Often the character is chosen to be mnemonic for its purpose, like choosing the letter l for long or r for reverse. By default, the ls command prints the results in alphabetical order, so adding the -r option will print the results in reverse alphabetical order.

```
ls -r
```

- Multiple options can be used at once, either given as separate options as in -l -r or combined like -lr. The output of all of these examples would be the same:

```
ls -l -r
ls -rl
ls -lr
```
