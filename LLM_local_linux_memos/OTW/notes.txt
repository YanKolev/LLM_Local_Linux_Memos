# Day 1 of OTW
-Started with OTW practices, was able to ssh to the remote client. Couple of fails until I figured out the syntax. 
-Passed level 0, Level 1 located the file with password, attempted scp to copy it to local machine, was not able, need to troubleshoot more.
-Look into alternative of scp and work the text with nano to copy it/or extract.
-Regular copy can also work/ KISS. (vim edit)
